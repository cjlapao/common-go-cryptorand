# common-go-cryptorand

![Code Coverage](./badges/coverage.svg)

Library to generate crypto random strings or numbers that are more random than the usual math/rand  
this will be good to use in security giving an more unpredictable randomness.

While it uses the standard math/rand it will use the crypto/rand to generate the seed for the math/rand
this will make it as the same as using crypto/rand but with the easy of use of math/rand

If you want to use the crypto/rand directly you can use the following functions:

```go
GetAlphaNumericRandomString()
GetAlphaRandomString()
GetNumericRandomString()
GetRandomString()
```

Those will directly use the crypto/rand to generate the random string while the `CryptoRand` will use the math/rand
with the crypto/rand as seed.
